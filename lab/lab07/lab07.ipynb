    "Indigenous people are the people who have inhabited a land area from the earliest times, before colonization, and have a way of life that is *inextricably linked* to that land. Over many thousands of years and more, indegenous folks learn and pass down wisdom about how humans can best support the local ecosystem they are a part of and depend on. This wisdom is sometimes called \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\" (TEK). Invasion by colonization across the world has caused many genocides of indigenous people and their lands, and has attempted to erase indigenous culture and TEK. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-azcPugmKQ) to see the impacts of colonialism on indigenous peoples here and discuss the following question:"

    "**Discussion Question 3:** In addition to protecting people and the ecosystems we are part of from dangerous wildfires, perscribed burns are needed for cultural resources that are essential to the Karuk and Yurok way of life. For this reason, Karuk and Yurok people (and many others indigenous peoples) refer to their prescribed fire as *cultural burns* that are central to subsistence and ceremonial practices. The term *cultural burning* distinguishes these fires from the fuel reduction-focused *prescribed burns* of public land agencies whose primary objective is to reduce fuel loads and moderate wildfire intensity. One of the ways cultural burns are central to Karuk and Yurok way of life, is that they provide more hazelnut stems that are needed for *basket weaving*, which we will learn more about in this activity.\n",
