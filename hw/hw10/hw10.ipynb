The true data are not even close to being linear (we can see the sea level may follow a higher-order pattern). We have produced the line of best fit, but that doesn't mean much when the data points are non-linear trending data; in other words, there will always be a line of best fit for any data, but that does not mean that the data itself is best fit by a linear model. In the rest of this assignment, we will continue to use linear models to study underlying trends in the direction of sea level rise, but this is strictly for practice.
